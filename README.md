# ReloadMoodleFirefoxExtension
A extension, which reloads inactive moodle links every 29 mins to prevent the current session from closing

This extension will not close documents (if it happens, let me know) and will not reload the tab if it is currently being viewed at.

TODO:
  - if the only open tab is a document or is an active moodle tab open a tab in the background and close it again instantly
